          SOEM ROS Package Upgrade Announcement
          =====================================
          
          Prior, due to the code layout in soem, a workaround
          has been necessary in users of this library.
          This version solves this issue now by
          providing proper cmake configuration files.
          
          If you've used the workaround of specifying
          `${soem_INCLUDE_DIRS}/soem` in the include_directories section
          in your code/library, you should remove this now.
          
          Also, this package has been upgraded to the upstream
          SOEM release 1.4.0.
          If you experience any problems, you can revert to
          release v1.3.0 of this package to retrieve the old state.
